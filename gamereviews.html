                    An absolute masterpiece. I've loved the Xenoblade series
                    ever since I played the first game, and Xenoblade 2 did not
                    disappoint as a sequel. Easily one of my favorite games of all 
                    time.

                <h6>The storytelling was simply masterful, and the gameplay was much more polished than the original. It 
                    took me around 80 hours to beat this game, but by the end, I was so invested in the story and characters
                    that I wanted more. But where it really shines is the music, which is absolutely heavenly.
                    Also has the best graphics in the series. Comfortably worthy
                    of a perfect score in my opinion, and I can't recommend this game enough.

                <h5 class="reviewtext">
                    My first game from the Warriors series, and clearly it was a great place
                    to start. A retelling of the prelude from Breath of the Wild, except the 
                    time travel antics keep it exciting and powerful right up to the very end. 
                    Has the best of both worlds: Warriors gameplay and music and BoTW story + graphics + characters.

                    The gameplay was strangely satisfying, even if it did become a bit repetitive.
                    There's just something inherently awesome about beating the crap out of so many
                    monsters, when I was getting dunked on by one or two in BoTW. The music was also surprisingly great, and the Warriors team did a fantastic job of incorporating the BoTW style and assets into this game. Story was also much better, characters were more developed, and it was overall more fun to play. Loved it!

                    Great game overall. Mario as usual sets aside the story and characters to focus almost
                    exclusively on the gameplay, and the development team definitely did great this time. 
                    The hat antics are fantastic, and there's so much cool stuff you can do without even 
                    realizing it in the tutorial sections. It's also very receptive to the player's style,
                    allowing you to beat the game with only a few moons but giving you access to like 7 times
                    as many, so you can advance at your own pace.

                    The music and graphics are solid, probably the best we've seen from a 3D Mario game,
                    but again it's the gameplay that really makes this one shine. Even if it isn't my 
                    favorite Switch game, I have a hard time denying that it's one of the console's 
                    masterpieces, and a must-have for most players.

                    story I've ever experienced, and I'm so glad I hacked my Wii so I could play this
                    game for myself instead of watching it on YouTube. Characters are awesome. Music is
                    heavenly. The main theme is probably my favorite piece of orchestral music of all time.

                    by today's standards. However, the Definitive Edition on the Switch really upped its game,
                    using the same engine that Xenoblade 2 used. It gave this game the upgrade it needed to be,
                    in my mind, one of the best games of all time. Really glad we got our boi Shulk into Smash,
                    and now hopefully we'll get some representation from Xenoblade 2!

                    I'm generally not a fan of Zelda games, just cause I don't really like the premise behind 
                    the game and I feel like all of em are basically the same. With the number of people that 
                    told me how groundbreaking BoTW was though, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.
                    Definitely one of the best games on the Switch, even if it isn't my favorite one. The visuals 
                    are to die for, and the music contributes very well to the overall ambient nature of the game.

                    Gameplay was pretty good as well, I basically played the game all the way through without 
                    touching any other games in the meantime. It definitely falls a little short in the story and 
                    character departments: most of the lore is told in a piecemeal flashback method, which is 
                    pretty annoying since I liked the premise of the story a lot. I think Age of Calamity did a good 
                    job of scratching this itch though, and it certainly doesn't take away from the fact that this is 
                    an amazing game overall. Would recommend to anyone looking for a single-player Switch game.

                    The true culmination of the Fire Emblem series so far. I've played a majority of the games 
                    prior to this one, and Three Houses just gets everything correct. From having some of the
                    series' best characters (Claude, Petra, Dmitri, Hapi) and the most hateable villains (you know
                    who you are), it's just a great game overall.

                <h6>
                    As usual, the gameplay is the perfect strategy style I was expecting, if not a tiny bit too easy. 
                    The music is ungodly, easily the best in the series so far, and that even includes the short DLC 
                    story's. Visuals are also a series best, and the story wouldn't be so great if it weren't for the 
                    fact that Three Houses has many different paths, which throws the replayability off the charts. 
                    Highly recommend this game to FE newcomers and veterans alike.

                    Just hilarious. Honestly I went into this game a little skeptical since the last 
                    few entries, though good, weren't on the order of Thousand Year Door. But the story 
                    of this one was just way better, and the classic Paper Mario comedy was brought back.
                    I actually cared about many of the characters, particularly Olivia, and I was engrossed 
                    in the story right up until the very end, even if it followed the standard formula. I 
                    will say there were some twists and turns I didn't see coming, which in a Mario game,
                    is always a plus.

                    Visuals are of course best in the series, but it's kind of hard to mess that up in 
                    Paper Mario. The cardboard/paper aesthetic was great, but I still hated the fact that 
                    most NPCs ended up being Toads. One thing this game totally killed though, as per usual,
                    was the music. The final dungeon theme especially was very good. I'd recommend this game 
                    to old and new Paper Mario fans alike. It's no Thousand Year Door, but it's great in its 
                    own right.

                    I took a chance on this game, and it was a good choice. It's a lot like Xenoblade, with a slightly 
                    de-emphasized story and objectively better gameplay. The story was still comfortably good for my 
                    expectations, and it took me 40-50 hours to beat. The characters are all Xenoblade-level fantastic,
                    and I loved seeing their interactions with each other. Could've done without the silent protagonist,
                    but what're you gonna do.

                    The two places this game really shines are the gameplay and music though. Music is a nice mix of exciting
                    guitar-based themes and ambient piano, and some of the battle melodies are excellent. The gameplay is closer 
                    to the Warriors series than to Xenoblade, which I actually quite enjoyed in a game of this style. I will
                    say the visuals left a bit to be desired, but honestly, I didn't care much since the rest of the game was 
                    so good. Definitely one of the best RPGs on the Switch.

                    Dark Moon and the original, but it didn't really add anything new to the mix: just kind of 
                    regurgitated old ideas. The fact that you get to solve each of the floors in turn was pretty 
                    interesting, and some were memorable, but it was still too linear overall. It was also way 
                    shorter than I imagined, taking me like 15 hours to beat, priced at the full 60 bucks.

                    and the game honestly just left a lot to be desired. Felt like it didn't take advantage of the 
                    Switch in the best ways it could have. I'd recommend this game only if you can find a pretty

                    money's worth. Characters are annoying, visuals are worse than Pokemon XD on the GameCube, 
                    the new Pokemon are honestly trash, and man the story is bad. The villain's intentions

                    Dragapult, Cinderace), and that the music is actually pretty great. The Gym Leader theme and Battle 
                    Tower theme in particular are pretty awesome, the latter having been composed by Toby Fox himself. 
                    Other than that though, I can't in good conscience say anything nice about this game. Hopefully

                    since repeated play can get old.

                    I honestly didn't like Blind Forest, the predecessor to this game, all that much. The gameplay 
                    felt pretty boring and I didn't even have the chance to finish. Will of the Wisps, however, 
                    takes all of the flaws of Blind Forest and fixes them, while making everything that was good 
                    about Blind Forest even better. The visuals are just breathtaking, even on my crappy laptop screen. 
                    Story was intriguing and kept me engaged to the end, and I honestly cared too much about each of 
                    the characters by the end of it, even the villain.

                    Music was ungodly (composed by Gareth Coker, nominated for a Game Award), particularly the use 
                    of leitmotif. The gameplay was also a huge step up from Blind Forest, and Ori's new moveset 
                    was just epic to watch. You can also choose your special moves, which makes for more customization
                    than one might expect. And for some reason, this game is only 40 bucks. Highly recommend, and if 
                    you can buy it, get it on Switch for optimal performance.

                    Was recommended this game by a friend, and I'm glad I picked it up. It's like an Indie version 
                    of Smash, with cool pixel art graphics and some really fun characters that all have their own 
                    unique antics. I also really liked how it includes Ori, the main character from one of my 
                    favorite Indie games. The music is also pretty good, though like Dragon Quest, there aren't enough 
                    tracks.

                    Probably the best parts of this game are the gameplay and visuals. It plays like Smash but more 
                    balanced, and mastering the characters in this game feels far more satisfying. I also, for some 
                    reason, like the 2D pixel art style a lot, even for an action game. Solid Indie game, do recommend.

                    and very easy for anyone to get into, even non-gamers. Graphics and cute characters remind 
                    me a lot of Boomerang Fu, but the gameplay is of course where this game shines as well. It's 
                    one of those games which can have your group shouting at each other one second, and all 
                    laughing in joy the next. Very worth the price.

                    Bought this game on a whim, just because I like monograms a lot. The trailers made it look 
                    like Ace Attorney Investigations, except with monograms thrown in every time you find a piece 
                    of evidence. And that's exactly what it was. Just like Ace Attorney, the visuals were solid and 
                    the characters surprisingly deep, with some decent music to back it up. The gameplay was pretty 
                    much entirely monograms and stepping through the story, but it kept me engaged throughout 
                    the game nevertheless.

                    really invested in the characters, though I'm not sure each of them was used to their fullest 
                    potential. Great game though, definitely recommend it.

                    simple, and yet, it's so much fun to run around with your friends and try to figure out who 
                    the imposter is. The best part is that if you get it on mobile, it's completely free. Even if

                    enjoy the kind of relaxed playstyle, especially during a year like 2020. I did have some 
                    fun with the online friend features at the beginning, but the main thing that waned my 
                    interest was that it just took too long for new stuff to happen. I played for about a month 
                    and then kind of gave up on it, cause it lost the ability to excite me. Not sure I can make a 
                    recommendation on whether or not to buy this one though, since I didn't like it much but many

                    to beat, but something about this game was just captivating. The music was exactly right 
                    for the beach/island setting, but what really drew me in was the story and the art style. 
                    I'm a complete sucker for that pixelated art-style done well, and this game certainly 
                    delivered on that. The story takes a pretty weird turn at one point, but it was overall

                    harder ones since I just wanted to see what happened next in the story, so I ended up 
                    skipping a few, but I think that's okay. Best part about this game is that it's only 
                    7 bucks, and even though it's a one and done thing, I think it's worth it.

                    (fewer options, strategy is simplistic), but it's got some great characters, visuals, and 
                    music going for it. It was awesome seeing some of my favorite Fire Emblem characters and

                    Unfortunately, the story is kind of crap, even for a Fire Emblem game. Most of the story 
                    consists of you going around collecting heroes, and then there's a few chapters at the 
                    end where some twists and things happen, but it just wasn't enough for me. It felt like I 
                    was grinding through the story just to get to the cool combat sequences and characters. 
                    Good game overall, but I'd recommend buying it on a discount: definitely not worth the full 60.

                    Honestly a little less than I was expecting. I bought this game cause it came from the 
                    developers of Bravely Default, one of my favorite series of all time, but it kind of 
                    disappointed me. The biggest thing that I didn't like was the fact that the characters, 
                    while interesting in their own right, never really interacted with each other. They each 
                    have their own stories and basically just fight together, but I live to see the interactions 
                    that the Bravely series does so well. As a result, I also found the story rather disjointed 
                    and unengaging, and the gameplay got repetitive too fast.

                    The music is absolutely incredible. My Quiet Forest Home, one of the tracks, is probably one 
                    of my favorite video game tracks of all time. The visuals also have a similar style to Evan's 
                    Remains, and I'm addicted to that kind of art style. The characters and environments are just 
                    breathtaking. I just wish the game had a good story, cast, and gameplay to back it up.

                    Another hidden indie gem. As of writing this review, I played this game a long time ago,
                    so I'll try to describe it as best I can. The way it works is that you get access to a color 
                    wheel, and at any point, you can change the background color to make objects or obstacles of 
                    that color "disappear". You can only make one such background color at a time, which leads 
                    to some pretty cool timing puzzle scenarios within this unique platformer.

                    music was hauntingly calm and serene, and the visuals, for their simplistic design, 
                    were top notch. The best part is that the price is 10 bucks, and it's often on sale since 
                    it's an older title. Highly recommend.

                    This game is part of the DLC expansion pass for Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I was
                    initially disappointed that the expanded story wasn't more of the main characters from 
                    XC2, but rather a prequel with some references to the main game. However, Torna the Golden
                    Country is truly amazing in its own right. They took everything restricted about the combat 
                    from Xenoblade 2 and did away with it, making the battles more fluid and fun. The final boss 
                    sequence was also probably the coolest I've seen in the Xenoblade series.

                    The visuals and music were incredible, as expected of pretty much any game of this series. 
                    The characters were also memorable, even the new ones that we barely got to see in the base 
                    game. Unfortunately, this expansions falls short of a perfect score due to its story. I'm 
                    generally not a fan of prequels since I know how it all plays out from the start, so the 
                    story was unable to surprise me in any significant way. Still, it was by no means a bad story,
                    and I recommend this expansion for anyone who's a hardcore Xenoblade fan.

                    the day it was announced, and I played it before replaying the base game when it came out. 
                    It was short and sweet for sure, and the best part about it was that we finally got to 
                    explore the Bionis Shoulder area, which many players, including myself, had been curious 
                    about since the original game's release in 2009. It was worth it.

                    really liked Kino and Nene, which is rare since I often don't like Nopon all that much. The 
                    music is also heavenly, with only 7 or so new tracks but almost all of them straight 
                    masterpieces. Sadly, the story fell short of my expectations, especially since I was hoping 
                    for a link to Xenoblade Chronicles 2's post-game world in there somewhere. Either way, I 
                    still recommend this to anyone who enjoyed either Xenoblade game.
